                <p>Removing price-tags of all kind from people, introducing the potential impact of the "relatively settable" affordable, that is combine-able with help-able.</p>

                    a bunch of "de-facto'ed" methods;
                    as in "over-prediction and manupilation of choice".</p>

                <p>Creating opportunity for an arbitrary purchase/transaction in general, to create impact; outside of its economical/taxational zone, that can enable the individuals societies to be part of the change, for all.</p>

                <p>As a result, we need to explore things that might exist but havenâ€™t yet been observed.</p>
