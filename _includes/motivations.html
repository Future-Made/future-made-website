                <p>Via enabling charitables/donations per purchase; aiming to create opportunity for an arbitrary purchase/transaction in general, to create impact; outside of its economical/taxational zone,

                    that have been enforcing
                    a bunch of "de-facto'ed" methods;
                    as in "over-prediction and manupilation of choice".</p>
