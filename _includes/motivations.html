                <p class="text-center">Purposefully experimenting, partially improving, or totally alternating on the existing paradigms, implementations and ways of thinkings. </p>

                    <p class="text-center"> In marketing, promotion and advertisement; along with demand-side-platforms and ad-networks in the mid/long run.</p>
                <p class="text-center">Empowering individual initiative-taking to be "effective" in the future, collective-decision making attempts and processes. </p>

            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <p class="text-center">Delegitimizing the "unnecessary" activities of tech-giants in
                    "consumer data business/advertisement" by depriving/dismissing what they are offering,

                    that have been enforcing
                    a bunch of "de-facto'ed" methods;
                    as in "over-prediction and manupilation of choice".</p>
                    <p class="text-center">Doing that by simply reducing the need for market places and required need for that(!) level of "prediction", in general.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3">

                <p class="text-center">Attempting to remove the as-is price-tags that are black-boxing (cost + profit),
                    and replace it with transparent (cost + profit expectancy); that is similar to a value-based pricing approach. </p>
                    <p class="text-center">
                        Introducing the potential impact of affordable, and make it possible to combine with things/services. Calling them helpables, that includes any efforts; knowledge/resource sharing that helps to the producers/creatives/sellers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center">Every life equally matters. That is why, regardless of the skill or service an individual provides, helpables will be counted in same value per second/minute/hour etc, <strong>globally. </strong> </p>

            <div class="col-lg-3">
                <p class="text-center">Via enabling charitables/donations per purchase; aiming to create opportunity for an arbitrary purchase/transaction in general, to create impact; outside of its economical/taxational zone,
                    that can enable the individuals and communities to be a part on <strong>the change, for all.</strong></p>
                <p class="text-center">Eliminating the limitation on individual impact scope; that have been long there, that inherently comes via citizenship or residentship.</p>
                <p class="text-center">As a result, we need to explore things that might exist but havenâ€™t yet been observed.</p>
