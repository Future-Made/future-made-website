description: The project will introduce a concept, called “a time-period-ahead”, aka. "demand-on-air", to be able to spread the gathering of "organic", semi-promising demands in time (even years, for regular/on-site art events), and already started on experimenting and implementing an efficiently transparent and anonymous framework. <br><br>Demand-ability of future online and regular performances would probably give the currently needed relief to artists on making their future tour plans or exhibitions with their audiences, along with other participants that are more observant. <br><br>As insights based on demand get clearer, and those demands happen to become more observable in clusters, there will be quite a lot of options that artists to evaluate, for the future regular/on-site events, in time, that could take years, if necessary.<br><br>Audiences, on the other hand, are incentivized to make decisions as early as possible, and demand flexibility around it.<br><br>Finding the bilateral consensus on the affordable, and multi-lateral consensus on when, where, why, how, etc will be discussed and confirmed in time, asynchronously. <br><br>Audiences will be enabled to demand with relative affordability and preferences, for different locations/platforms and hence enabled to express indirect costs of their attendance.
