description: <p>Project scopes the term, Universal Basic Experience highly relating to an individual, community basically in need or desire to engage with creative & intellectual work; experiencing and freely witnessing their ideation, creation/performance and impact processes in their highest achievable and inclusive form. </p> <p>Micro-levels of help and ability to diversify the impact is a need on mutually sharing the feeling of "welcoming, respecting and togetherness" and having opportunity to create awareness and resources via demanding that inclusion.</p> <p>Demanding those resources and experiences would be "wants" or for some however, they are and they will be still "needs" for all.<br> New Economics Forum (nef) articulates on the equality on their recent <a href="https://neweconomics.org/uploads/files/eafb0135c69d8a9152_yum6bt9zh.pdf"><strong>paper,</strong></a> like this >> <br> <p><i>Social justice involves wellbeing for all, not just for some. So quality, like wellbeing, is central to our concept of social justice. There are countless definitions of equality. <br><br>For our purposes, it can be understood as a society where everyone is of equal worth before the law and has an equal chance to flourish. Promoting equality in this sense is not about trying to make everyone live in the same way. It goes well beyond prohibiting unequal and unfair treatment of individuals, promoting anti-poverty strategies, or building ‘resilience’ among disadvantaged groups. <br><br> These may help but they are not enough. Promoting equality is about creating genuinely equal life chances between those who are currently rich or poor, powerful or powerless. It involves eliminating conditions that give rise to privilege and unfair advantage. This requires a systemic approach, one that tackles the fundamental causes of inequality.</i></p>
