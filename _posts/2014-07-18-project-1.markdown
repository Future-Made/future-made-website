description: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=370&v=e1xKUZCf7PA&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"><strong> A bottom-up process of liberation, via Extending the Freedom of Expression with Expression of Demand. </strong></a>        <br><br>                               Basically, it is an activity, as in expressing the demand for a service/experience or resource/good, without waiting for it to be placed on a market place or announced. <br> Efforts in the projects in general, being made to contemplate on a demand-augmented framework, for the enablement of making the outputs of future decision-making processes more foreseeable, while enabling (almost) self-promoting & incentivising activities and relationships-making. <br><br>                                                                                  This aims to make it easier for individuals and communities in the tangible nature of declaring or hiding intentions and actions, on the future resolutions. Within the projects, it is intended to achieve the expression of demand via augmenting with preferences of the demand side. <br><br>                <a href="https://www.nimmonsconsulting.com/smart-thinking/the-consequences-model" target="_blank"> <strong>Consequences Model </strong> </a>, is one of the theories that partially inspired this project, encourages making decisions as early as possible, that mostly applies and incentivices demand exposition by the consumers/audiences, that would make declarations of potential future purchase, without making a prior, tightly binding contract, that is available there for further review of the producer/provider.
